## Problem Statement

### The Fragmentation Crisis

Underwater hockey faces a unique challenge: despite being played in 30+ countries with biennial world championships, the community remains severely fragmented due to:

1. **Split Governance**: Two competing world bodies (CMAS and former WUWH) created organizational fragmentation
2. **Geographic Dispersion**: Small player populations spread across vast distances
3. **Pool Dependency**: Sport requires specific pool dimensions (25m x 15m, 2-4m depth), limiting growth
4. **Information Scarcity**: Club information is notoriously hard to find—a player literally built UWHMap.com because "club information can be hard to find"

### Specific Pain Points

| Pain Point | Current State | Impact |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| **Finding Clubs** | Scattered across Meetup, Facebook groups, outdated websites | New players give up before starting |
| **Session Schedules** | Word-of-mouth, WhatsApp groups, email chains | Missed sessions, inconsistent attendance |
| **Player Matching** | No system exists | Unbalanced games, poor experience for beginners |
| **Equipment** | No tracking or sharing system | Expensive barrier to entry, lost/damaged gear |
| **Competitions** | Fragmented calendars across governing bodies | Missed registration deadlines, travel planning chaos |
| **Training Progress** | No specialized tracking tools | Players can't measure improvement |
